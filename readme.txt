Please read the notes below regarding set-up. 

Burning EXE Version to CD-ROMS (with Auto-run)
Place ALL files inside the ZIP you just downloaded into the "root" level 
of the CD-ROM you wish to burn. DO NOT change any names of the files, or
add new directories or folders. Everything must be placed on the CD-ROM 
EXACTLY as it was "unzipped".

NOTE for MAC Users: The EXE version only works on Windows 2000 or later 
Computers.

Uploading SWF Version to Your Own Web Server
Upload ALL files inside the ZIP you just downloaded into the *same* 
directory on your web server as the html page which will be displaying 
the SWF file. We have included this page (named "index.html"), however 
you may change the name of the page or create a new one. Please remember 
to upload ALL files.
